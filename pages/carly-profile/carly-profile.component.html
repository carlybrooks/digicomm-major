        Hi there! I'm Carly Brooks and I'm a senior Digital Communications major. I'm also majoring in Chinese and minoring in Film and Media.
        What I love about this major is how versatile it is. Even though Abby, Lindsay, and I are all digi comm majors, there are still so many different
        avenues we can take with Digital Communications. I have a passion for visual storytelling so that is why my concentration is in film and media. 
        Editing videos for me is like putting a puzzle together, piece by piece, you create this magnificient and beautiful moving picture.
